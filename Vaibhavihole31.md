## About

Hey there 🙋🏻‍♀️

I'm Vaibhavi Hole, a tech enthusiast with a zest for continuous learning and sharing knowledge. I might have left college, but that hasn't stopped me from making waves in the tech world at just 20!

At Road To Code, I wear the hat of a Founder. I've been guiding students, helping them navigate the world of full-stack development using the MERN Stack. I'm the architect behind our platform [https://roadtocode.org](https://roadtocode.org), constantly refining it to ensure our students have the best learning experience and land their first internships. 🎓💻

I'm armed with a robust set of skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, NextJS, and MySQL. These tools empower me to construct scalable full-stack applications.

As a certified AWS cloud practitioner ☁️, I've got the lowdown on the AWS Cloud. I regularly share nuggets on LinkedIn to help others ace the AWS cloud practitioner exam.
